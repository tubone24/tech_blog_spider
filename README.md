> Crawls tech blogs and notifies you via Slack

## Background

Software engineers often subscribe to various tech blogs in order to keep up with the ever-evolving technology domain.

However, visiting many tech blogs each time is a painstaking task, and I would like to receive feeds to help me subscribe if possible.

Of course, you can use a dedicated feeder to receive feeds, but I'd like to send feeds to Slack, which I usually use for work, so that I can subscribe to tech blogs without having to consciously open feeder.
